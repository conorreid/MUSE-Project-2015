Use Alt+11 to open up Macros in Excel

The function returns a numeric value. If you want to create an even shorter macro to do the processing, consider the following:
Function StripChar(aText As String)
    Dim I As Integer

    StripChar = ""
    For I = 1 To Len(aText)
        aChar = Mid(aText, I, 1)
        Select Case aChar
            Case "0" To "9"
                StripChar = StripChar & aChar
        End Select
    Next
End Function
To use this function, use either of the following in your worksheet:
=STRIPCHAR(A1)
=VALUE(STRIPCHAR(A1))
